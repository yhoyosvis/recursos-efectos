Instructions on how to install a skin:

1. Rename the .css file in the skin's folder to "timeliner.css"
2. Copy it to the css folder inside the plugin folder. Delete the old .css file if necessary
3. If there is a sprite image in the skin folder, copy it to the "img" folder, inside the plugin folder.

That's all!
